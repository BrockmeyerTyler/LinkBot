# LinkBot
Hello! This is my discord bot, LinkBot. He is made in Python, using [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). You can find the documentation [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
## Features
- A per-server Admin system that restricts Admin level commands from being used by non-admins.
- A per-server Quote database in which Admins can immortalize their friends' most disappointing, out-of-context statements.
- A per-server Birthday tracking system. Have an Admin set birthdays for everyone (who is important) and have LinkBot with them Happy Birthday when it comes!
- Youtube video and Google image first-result search embedding.
- Plus more, and more to come in the future!
